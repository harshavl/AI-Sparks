AI-Driven Network Documentation and Visualization
Concept: Convert unstructured network data (e.g., configs, logs) into interactive, human-readable visualizations like mind maps or topology graphs.
Implementation: Use an LLM pipeline (e.g., with MindsDB or custom scripts) to summarize device configurations and generate visualizations via PyVis or Edraw.AI, integrating with Nautobot for structured data.
Impact: Simplifies onboarding, troubleshooting, and network planning for engineers.
Predictive Maintenance for Network Devices
Concept: Leverage AI to predict hardware failures or performance degradation in network devices (e.g., routers, switches) based on telemetry data.
Implementation: Train Random Forest or DNN models on metrics like CPU usage, memory, or error rates, using tools like Prometheus for data collection and Grafana for visualization.
Impact: Reduces unexpected outages and optimizes maintenance schedules.
Dynamic Interface Description Standardization
Concept: Use AI to generate and maintain standardized, human- and machine-readable interface descriptions across heterogeneous network devices.
Implementation: Build on a solution like the InterfaceDescription class, using NLP to parse and standardize descriptions with delimiters (e.g., ":" for scripted fields, "||" for manual notes). Integrate with Nautobot and Kentik for compatibility.
Impact: Ensures consistency, improves automation, and simplifies network audits.
AI-Powered Network Capacity Planning
Concept: Forecast future network capacity needs using AI to analyze usage trends, application demands, and growth projections.
Implementation: Use time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA or LSTMs) on data from monitoring tools like SolarWinds. Generate actionable reports for infrastructure upgrades.
Impact: Prevents overprovisioning or underprovisioning, optimizing cost and performance.
 AI-Optimized Zero Trust Networking
Concept: Implement AI to enforce zero trust policies by continuously validating devices, users, and traffic in real-time.
Implementation: Use ML models to assess risk scores based on behavior, device health, and context, integrating with tools like Zscaler or Palo Alto Networks.
Impact: Strengthens network security by dynamically adapting access controls.
Cross-Vendor Network Interoperability
Idea: Use LLMs to bridge compatibility gaps between multi-vendor network devices.
How it Works: The LLM interprets commands and configurations from different vendors (e.g., Cisco, Juniper, Arista) and translates them into a unified format or generates vendor-agnostic automation scripts. It can also assist in migrating configurations across vendors.
LLMOps Role: Fine-tune the LLM on vendor-specific CLI syntax and APIs, maintain a knowledge base of interoperability issues, and deploy in hybrid environments.
Impact: Simplifies multi-vendor network management and reduces vendor lock-in.
Natural Language Network Troubleshooting Assistant
Idea: Crenal AI assistant for network engineers to troubleshoot issues using natural language queries.
How it Works: Network engineers interact with the LLM via a chat interface, asking questions like "Why is the latency high on VLAN 10?" The LLM processes network logs, topology data, and historical issues to provide step-by-step troubleshooting guidance or automated fixes.
LLMOps Role: Train the LLM on networking documentation (e.g., Cisco, Juniper manuals), maintain a knowledge base of common issues, and integrate with network management tools for real-time data access.
Impact: Lowers the skill barrier for junior engineers and speeds up issue resolution for complex networks.
Network Capacity Planning and Forecasting
Description: LLMs can predict future network capacity needs using Nautobot’s historical and real-time data.
How it Works: The LLM analyzes Nautobot’s telemetry data (e.g., interface utilization, IP address usage) and external factors (e.g., business growth projections) to forecast bandwidth or resource requirements. For example, it might suggest "Add 10 Gbps capacity to site X by Q3 2026." Nautobot’s Capacity Metrics App can feed data to the LLM via Prometheus.docs.nautobot.com
LLMOps Role: Train the LLM on time-series network data and integrate with Nautobot’s APIs for real-time data access. Validate predictions against actual usage to improve accuracy.
Impact: Optimizes resource allocation, reduces costs, and ensures scalability.
